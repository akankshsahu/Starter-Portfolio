# Data Science Portfolio â€” 3 Projects + Portfolio + Deploy
In the "projects" folder, you will find the 3 beginner projects I have completed. If you would like to download them and run these projects, I highly suggest going to the SETUP.md file in the docs folder. This will give you step-by-step instructions for installing the correct tools and libraries. Portfolio website up soon!
