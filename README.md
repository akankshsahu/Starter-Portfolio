# 3 Initial Projects
In the "projects" folder, you will find the 3 beginner projects I have completed. The first project is an NFL Rookie Analysis that predicts their capability to play in the Pro Bowl based on their rookie year statistics. There's also an Exoplanet Habitability Predictor that draws on the knowledge of my previous major in Astronomy. This project analyzes NASA data and gives a score of 0 (uninhabitable) or 1 (possibly inhabitable) based on a variety of measured values. The last project is a COVID-19 dashboard that combs through large datasets to show the statistics from the pandemic. If you would like to download and run these projects, I highly recommend visiting the SETUP.md file in the docs folder. This will provide you with step-by-step instructions for installing the necessary tools and libraries. Portfolio website up soon!
